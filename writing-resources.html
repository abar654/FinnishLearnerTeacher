      <div class="section-text">There are lots of ways to practice writing in Finnish aside from doing exercises from a textbook. You can interact with real Finns through writing, use learning apps, or even write to yourself.</br></br>Below you will find recommendations for a variety of resource types. Each resource type has examples which are labelled based on what learning level they are appropriate for:</div>
      <ul class="section-text">
        <li><strong>Complete Beginner</strong> (A0-A1)</li>
        <li><strong>Beginner</strong> (A1-A2)</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate</strong> (A2-B1)</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="section-text">I have also given each resource a star rating (out of 3) based on how useful it is <strong>for this particular skill</strong> (but keep in mind the same resource may have a different rating for other skills).</div>

      <div class="section-heading"><h3>A NOTE ON FEEDBACK:</h3></div>
      <div class="section-text">It is always helpful to be able to get some sort of feedback on your writing, but this doesn't have to be from a teacher or a set of answers in your book. Finnish friends and acquaintances can help you correct your writing, but you can even get informal feedback when interacting with Finns through writing just from the way that they respond. Of course if you want to write without any feedback that can still be really good practice as well.</br></br></div>
