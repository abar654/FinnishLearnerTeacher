      <div class="section-heading"><h1>First Steps: Getting Started with Finnish</h1></div>
      <img class="section-image" src="Images/first-steps.jfif">
      <div class="section-text">Learning a new language seems like a daunting task and it can be hard to know where to start. Ideally you would have a teacher but for many of us that is not an option. This guide should help give you an idea of what order to learn things if you are going down the <strong>independent learning</strong> road. </br></br>You want to learn in an order that is <strong>easy</strong>, but also in an order that is <strong>useful</strong> and allows you to actually <strong>communicate with your new skills</strong>. That's why you learn a language after all, to communicate. </br></br>If you are just starting out here is the order that I would suggest.</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Step 1. Learn to pronounce Finnish.</h2></div>
      <img class="section-image" src="Images/pronunciation-important.jpg">
      <div class="section-text">It is a lot simpler than it seems at first and once you can do this it makes all your listening and speaking much easier. Every letter is pronounced exactly the same way (no matter where it is in the word) almost all the time. </br></br>Read <a class="styled-link" href="#">this guide</a> and you should be able to pronounce any Finnish word even if you've never heard or seen it before.</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Step 2. Learn to count to 100.</h2></div>
      <img class="section-image" src="Images/counting-hard.jpg">
      <div class="section-text">You can start to practice your pronunciation/spelling and numbers are something you will always need.</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Step 3. Learn vocabulary.</h2></div>
      <img class="section-image" src="Images/know-words.jpg">
      <div class="section-text">There is no point trying to learn grammar if you don't have any words to apply the grammar too. Trying to build sentences without vocab is like trying to build a house without bricks (oh wait, they do that in Finland all the time... But you get my point). You will also understand more by learning vocab rather than grammar to begin with. </br></br>For example, it's more important to know that the word "auttakaa" is using the verb "auttaa", meaning "to help", rather than knowing that it is the 2nd person, plural, imperative form of the verb, when you hear someone screaming it at you. <.br></br>Don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying grammar isn't important (I love grammar), I'm just saying to learn a good bank of vocab first.</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Step 4. Learn question words and some important "little words".</h2></div>
      <div class="section-text">These are basically just more vocab but they are particularly important for general understanding. A few examples are: mikä (what), missä (where), milloin (when), and kuka (who).</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Step 5. Learn present tense verbs.</h2></div>
      <img class="section-image" src="Images/present-gift.jpg">
      <div class="section-text">Present tense is the easiest and the tense you'll use the most. Once you learn it you will be able to start putting together loads of meaningful sentences.</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Step 6. Learn what a <strong>case</strong> is.</h2></div>
      <img class="section-image" src="Images/less-cases.jfif">
      <div class="section-text">Before you start trying to learn how to form cases it's worth trying to understand what the point of them actually is. </br></br>In short, they give us more information about how the noun that is using the case fits in the sentence, much like prepositions in English such as: in, on, from, to, of, for, at, by" etc).</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Step 7. Learn what the partitive case is and how to form it in the singular.</h2></div>
      <div class="section-text">You want to be able to understand partitive but DON'T get hung up on when to use it because it's the kind of thing that will come with experience. </br></br>People can still understand you almost perfectly if you use nominative (the standard form) rather than partititive. You'll learn it with time, so don't stress about it now. </br></br>Forming partitive in the singular is easy but don't bother with partitive plural just yet (unless you really enjoy being confused).</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Step 8. Learn the genetive case.</h2></div>
      <img class="section-image" src="Images/mine.jfif">
      <div class="section-text">This is the case for showing possession (a bit like we use 's at the end of words in English). It's used for other things too but it's really easy to form and very important.</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Step 9. Learn the locative cases.</h2></div>
      <div class="section-text">You can think of these as the cases that replace "to, in, on, from" in English. They are pretty easy to form and understand and are definitely important for being able to communicate.</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Step 10. Learn the imperfect tense.</h2></div>
      <img class="section-image" src="Images/the-past.jfif">
      <div class="section-text">This is the most common form of past tense. It's quite well related to the present tense so if you have got a good handle on that already then you should pick it up alright.</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Congratulations!</h2></div>
      <div class="section-text">If you get to this point then you are already doing really well and should have the grammar to communicate quite a lot already and make yourself understood in many situations!</div>
