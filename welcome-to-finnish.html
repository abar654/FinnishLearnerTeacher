      <div class="section-text">Finnish frequently ranks in the top 10, if not the top 5, most difficult languages in the world for English speakers to learn. </br></br>There are plenty of good reasons for this reputation but some times it may also be a little <strong>"over-hyped"</strong>.</br></br> Let's take a quick look at the good news, and the bad news for Finnish learners.</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Bad News (let's get it out of the way first):</h2></div>
      <img class="section-image" src="Images/bad-news.jpg">
      <div class="section-text">When we form sentences in English we don't really have to tranform the individual words very much. Sure we change around the order that we use the words in each sentence, but other than conjugating verbs (and sometimes adding an 's' to a noun for plurals) the words themselves stay pretty much the same.</br></br>Perhaps the most overwhelming aspect of learning Finnish is that in every different sentence not only do you have to transform the verbs (conjugation) into different combinations of number, person and tense, but you also have to transform the nouns, adjectives, and adverbs (declension) in to no less than <strong>15 different cases!</strong> That's a lot of work for your brain, so it's no surprise that new learners get overwhelmed. </br></br>Add to this the fact that spoken Finnish (puhekieli) is quite different from written Finnish (kirjakieli) and also varies with location and you can really start to see a challenge. </br></br>*sidenote: If you really want to annoy Finnish people tell them you can't wait to see polar bears in Finland (they don't have any!). </div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h2>Good News:</h2></div>
      <img class="section-image" src="Images/good-news.jpg">
      <div class="section-text">Once you break through the surface of learning Finnish, many learners find that it <strong>really isn't as bad as it is made out to be</strong>. </br></br>There are also a lot of things that make the language great to learn such as the predictable pronounciation, the flexible word ordering, and the mysterious logic that seems to underly the language with surprisingly few "exceptions" once you learn the many grammar rules. </br></br>There are many great articles out there on why Finnish really isn't so bad (one of my favourites can be found here at
      <a class="styled-link" href="https://thefinnishteacher.weebly.com/finnish-an-easy-language-to-learn.html">The Finnish Teacher</a>
      which you can read if you're still feeling a bit scared). </br></br>The difficulty aside, Finnish is also undoubtedly a very cool language. If you learn to speak it you will have the closest thing to a secret language which only Finns will understand where ever you go in the world (it's not like French or Spanish which have hundreds of millions of speakers who can understand you, or where an eavesdropping english speaker can guess what you're talking about). </br></br>Aside from the practical coolness, here are three of my favourite examples of the magic and wonder of Finnish.</div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h3>Example 1: A grammatically correct sentence in Finnish</h3></div>
      <div class="section-example">
        <div class="example-question">Keksij채 Keksi keksi keksin keksitty채채n keksin keksij채 Keksi keksi keksin keksityksi.</div>
        <div class="example-answer">Inventor Cookie, invented the cookie. After inventor Cookie had invented the cookie, he invented that the cookie was invented.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h3>Example 2: A complete and grammatically correct conversation in Finnish</h3></div>
      <div class="section-example">
        <div class="example-question">Kokoo koko kokko kokoon.</br>Koko kokkoko kokoon? </br>Koko kokko kokoon.</div>
        <div class="example-answer">Gather together the whole bonfire.</br>The whole bonfine together?</br>The whole bonfire together.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-heading"><h3>Example 3: A single phrase with 9 meanings</h3></div>
